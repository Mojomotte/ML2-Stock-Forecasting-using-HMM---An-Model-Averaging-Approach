# ML2-Stock-Forecasting-using-HMM---An-Model-Averaging-Approach

New approach to stockforecasting using HMM methods combined with model averaging. The HMM method is based on 

NGUYEN, N. (2016): “Stock Price Prediction using Hidden Markov Model,” 
(https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=SILC2016&paper_id=38)

Several Models with a different number of hidden states are trained and their results are averaged by three different methods: 
- Naive Model Averaging
- Total Model Averaging
- Selective Model Averaging

The results of testing this new approach on 4 different real data series shows better results compared to the standard method.
